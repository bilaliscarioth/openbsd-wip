A tool similar to cloc, sloccount and tokei. For counting the lines of
code, blank lines, comment lines, and physical lines of source code in
many programming languages.

Goal is to be the fastest code counter possible, but also perform COCOMO
calculation like sloccount, estimate code complexity similar to
cyclomatic complexity calculators and produce unique lines of code or
DRYness metrics.
