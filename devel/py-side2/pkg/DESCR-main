PySide2 is the official Python module from the Qt for Python project,
which provides access to the complete Qt 5.12+ framework.

The Qt for Python project is developed in the open, with all
facilities you'd expect from any modern OSS project such as all
code in a git repository and an open design process. We welcome any
contribution conforming to the Qt Contribution Agreement.


The Qt for Python project aims to provide a complete port of the
PySide module to Qt.
