Ordinary local file IO is blocking, and cannot easily and portably be made
asynchronous.  This means doing file IO may interfere with asyncio applications,
which shouldn't block the executing thread.  aiofiles helps with this by
introducing asynchronous versions of files that support delegating operations to
a separate thread pool.
