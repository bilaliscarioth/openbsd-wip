While many status bars for simple X window managers do not (yet)
support StatusNotifierItem for displaying system tray icons, some
software does not fall back to the widely supported XEmbed-based
tray icon protocol. snixembed acts as a proxy between the new and
old. (It does this by presenting itself as a StatusNotifierHost on
the session bus, and using GTK+3 to maintain corresponding XEmbed
tray icons.)
