This library provides a Python interface for the undocumented and self-made
Yandex Music API.

It supports both synchronous and asynchronous (asyncio) code.

In addition to that, this library has a number of high-level object wrapper
classes to make client and script development simple and straightforward.
All documentation was written from scratch based on logical analysis during
reverse engineering of the API.
