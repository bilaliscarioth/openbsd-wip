libpnupnp is a C++ reimplementation of the venerable libupnp, a.k.a. Portable
UPnP* library. Most of the API is unchanged, except where libupnp exposed its
internal XML ixml library DOM objects.

One principal objective of the evolution was to make the transition as easy as
possible for a program currently using libupnp. The structure of the C API is
conserved.

Beyond issues of reliability and maintability, the main evolution in the new
library is the support for multiple network interfaces. Also, the library
exposes helper code for parsing an UPnP device description document and for
accessing the machine network interfaces.

libnupnp implements a low level interface to the UPnP protocol. It has a
separate set of functions for client and device implementations, with a few
common functions, mostly for initialization and termination.
